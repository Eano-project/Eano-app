🚀 About EANO
EANO is a decentralized platform that merges free crypto mining, gaming, and AI-powered creative tools into a single user-driven ecosystem. At its core, EANO puts power in the hands of its users — allowing them to vote, decide, and shape future features on the platform.

🌟 Core Features
⛏️ Free Mining
Users earn EANO tokens at a fixed rate (0.600/hr), with sessions recorded via Firebase for real-time tracking and persistence.

🕹️ Gaming
Includes both single and multiplayer games. Competitive, fun, and designed for global reach.

🎙️ Studio
AI-powered studio where users can write lyrics, compose, and produce songs with instruments provided by the system. Users can post, like, comment, and share their works — including video support.

🛍️ Marketplace
A decentralized commerce zone where users can buy and sell digital and physical goods.

👥 Community-Driven Governance
Users can propose and vote on future platform updates, features, and system improvements.
